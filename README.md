# Assingment 3 Caesar Encryption

Firstly, run 'build.bat' file to build the dll and link it to exe.
Then run the 'TextEditor.exe'. This program may be familiar to you. Yes, this is text editor from first and second assingment.
So, lets begin testing.
Start with simple one line text to encrypt with 'a' command to append.

Then we can encrypt it with '/' command. Print result with 'p'

Now, lets get our text back by decrypting it with '\' command and same shift amount

Ok, basics works. Lets encrypt something way bigger.                      
Load the 'sherlock.txt' with 'l' command and encrypt it, but not with normal shift, use values higher than 26

Then print result with 'p'. As you can see encoding does well despite of large amount of text and enormous shift

Now decode it back with same shift and print
